<p>Hi, I am a journalism student at the <a href="https://www.umd.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Maryland</a>. I am from Westport, Connecticut. I have 2 sisters and 1 brother. I also have a pet pig named Craig, a cat named Coconut, and a bulldog named Clementine. I really like Kanye West and vintage clothing.</p>

<p><strong>I am very excited for this semester and being back in person!</strong><p>

<h3><font color="blue"> Why I love journalism </font></h3>
<p>I got involved in journalism my freshman year of high school. I was the sports editor of my newspaper, then the news editor and finished as the managing editor my junior year. Since I have been at Maryland, I have found a passion for videography and photography. I love being behind the camera and watching documentaries.<p>

<h4><font color="yellow">What I hope for in this class</font></h4>
<p>I love coding. I hope to be able to create webpages for future projects and understand code when I look at pages created by others.<p>
