  <p>Jaclyn Santangelo awoke at her College Park, Maryland residence on Sept. 11 at 3:03 a.m. by a loud noise and a deep, unfamiliar voice. Santangelo is not the only College Park resident to experience an incident like this.
  </p>
  <p>
  Since 2018, residential crimes have risen, on and off campus, due to a lack of security, according to UMPD crime reports.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I don't feel safe living here.." Santangelo, a senior accounting major, said. "I feel like the police didn’t handle this situation seriously,” 
  </p>
  <p>
  Santangelo lives in an off-campus house with six other UMD students. They believe the intruder was able to enter their house because the front door was not locked.
  </p>
  <p>
  “I wasn't really satisfied with how the police handled the situation…I was still shaking and really freaked out and they were just standing there and it seemed like they were almost laughing,” Santangelo said. 
  </p>
  <p>
  Santangelo’s house experienced another suspected intruder this year. According to Santangelo, a man dressed as an employee for a security system company tried to enter her home a few weeks after the original incident.
  </p>
  <p>
  In both situations, the local College Park police did not follow up and no suspects were identified or caught.
  </p>
  <p>
  There have been eight reported residential robberies in College Park this year and one residential burglary, according to the City of College Park crime report.
  </p>
  <p>
  A burglary is an unlawful entrance into a building with the intent to commit theft. A residential robbery involves force used to take something from a person’s home.
  </p>
  <p>
  In 2019, 29 burglaries occurred on UMD campus as well as three robberies, according to the UMPD crime report. Sergeant Rosanne Hoaas, Spokesperson for the University of Maryland Police Department, said this is the first spike in crime incidents in recent years. 
  </p>
    <p>
  UMD crimes on campus had fallen from 2013 to 2018 but have now risen again, according to the UMPD crime report. Hoaas credits this spike in 2019 to the COVID-19 pandemic.While the number of crimes decreased from 2019 to 2020, it was still higher than those reported in 2018. 
  </p>
    <p>
  There are over 500 security cameras on campus and swipe cards so only students are able enter their residence halls at night, according to Hoaas. Hoaas also stated that all crimes committed on UMD campus do not have malice intentions. 
  </p>
    <p>
  “We've had a couple cases over the years where an individual has entered the wrong resident hall room and alcohol is a factor,” Hoaas said. “In those cases, the person who unintentionally committed the offense will call us and say they think that was them.”
  </p>
    <p>
  Hoaas urges students to lock their residences and call the UMPD when something suspicious occurs to prevent these residential crimes from occuring.
  </p>
    <p>
  While the number of reported residential burglaries is eight this year for College Park, according to the City of College Park crime report, it is likely that there have been more that have occurred.
  </p>
  <blockquote style="color: blueviolet;">
“We just don't do a great job of counting crime at the local level and measuring crime at the local level. And that's a problem that exists throughout the country,” Robert Brame, a criminology professor at UMD, said. 
  </blockquote>
  <p>
  Only roughly 33% of property related crimes, including burglaries and home invasions, are reported to the police in the United States, according to the National Crime Victimization Survey by the Department of Justice.
  </p>
  <p>
  “Predatory crimes are more likely to occur when there is a motivated offender, suitable or attractive target and absence of capable guardians,” Brame said. 
  </p>
  <p>
  College students fit that mold which makes them more prone to robberies according to Brame. Brame also credits the locations of universities to the impact it has on the crime rates.
  </p>
  <p>
  “A large university located in an urban area is going to present different issues than a large university that's in a small university town.”
  </p>
  <p>
  While the exact number of residential crimes on and around UMD campus is not clear, there has been a rise since 2019. Residents of College Park and UMD campus need to take the proper precautions to ensure their safety.
